========================================================
AUTOMATED NETWORK RECONNAISSANCE USING NMAP AND BASH
========================================================

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
---------------------

1. Setup your environment:
   - Install Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended) or use a virtual machine
   - Install Nmap: sudo apt-get install nmap
   - Clone the repository or copy all the files to a directory

2. Make the scripts executable:
   - chmod +x scan.sh
   - chmod +x example_usage.sh

3. Running the scanner:

   a) Interactive mode:
      ./scan.sh
      
      This will prompt you to enter a target IP/domain
      
   b) Command-line mode with options:
      ./scan.sh -t 192.168.1.1 -m quick
      ./scan.sh -t example.com -m full -o xml
      ./scan.sh -h (for help)

4. View the examples:
   ./example_usage.sh

5. Finding your results:
   - All scan results are stored in the results/ directory
   - Files are named using the format: [target]_[timestamp]_scan.txt

IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES
---------------------

1. ONLY scan systems you own or have explicit permission to scan
2. Unauthorized scanning may be illegal and unethical
3. For educational purposes, use:
   - Your own home network
   - Virtual machines you control
   - Public scanning test sites (e.g., scanme.nmap.org with limitations)
   
4. Practice responsible security testing

PROJECT EXTENSIONS
-----------------

1. Add HTML report generation
2. Implement email notifications for critical findings
3. Add custom scan profiles for specific needs
4. Create an interactive menu system
5. Integrate with other security tools
